# Base Package-as-a-Plugin for plugins made by KK-Koha team

this is not standalone plugin, but just a "library" (or "module"),
intended to be used as base plugin for any other KK-Dev team made
modules.

This module extends and replaces some behaviour in Koha system,
yet this made in hacky way (adding some special address space),
but this makes possibility to unify and simplify all other plugins,
which KK-Dev/Nugged Team makes.
